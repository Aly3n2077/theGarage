We propose an integrated automotive venture that combines an online marketplace for cars and motorcycles with a physical service garage, targeting South African and Zimbabwean customers. The platform will let users buy and sell vehicles and book panel-beating, painting, or repair appointments at our partner-operated workshop. We will also offer value-added products – notably extended warranties and financing assistance – to build customer trust and streamline transactions. The business is split between two partners: one manages all brick-and-mortar operations (garage services, vehicle procurement and reconditioning, inventory management), while the other handles the online platform (IT development, e-commerce management, digital marketing and customer support).
Growing market opportunity: African used-vehicle demand is surging. Industry analysts project the Africa used-car market will grow at ~8.7% CAGR through 2030​

. South Africa alone accounts for roughly 27% of that market​

. Online listings have exploded – for example, AutoTrader reported nearly 100,000 more vehicles listed in the first half of 2023 than in the same period of 2020​

Trusted, full-service offering: South African buyers increasingly seek certified pre-owned vehicles backed by warranties and financing options​

. By bundling warranty contracts and finance assistance, we meet this demand and differentiate our platform. Zimbabwe’s e-commerce growth (fueled by mobile payments like EcoCash​

) suggests a receptive market for online car sales and service bookings.
Partnered operating model: One partner focuses on the garage: sourcing vehicles (e.g. from auctions, trade-ins or import), reconditioning and certifying them, performing bodywork and repairs, and managing parts inventory. The other partner builds and markets the digital platform: developing user-friendly listings and booking features, integrating secure payment gateways, driving SEO/social channels, and providing online customer support.
This one-stop, scalable model meets the rising demand for affordable, reliable vehicles and maintenance. It is designed for steady startup growth and can expand into accessories, spare parts and rentals as the business matures.
Business Model
Our business is essentially a multi-sided automotive marketplace plus service center. We generate revenue from vehicle transactions, service bookings, and ancillary products. Key customer segments include:
Individual buyers and sellers (B2C): Private motorists looking to sell or purchase used cars or bikes. We act as a trusted intermediary with easy online listings.
Dealers and small fleets (B2B): Local dealers or corporate fleets who want to reach a wider audience. We can offer bulk listing packages or consignment sales.
Service customers (B2C/B2B): Car and bike owners who need repairs, collision/bodywork (panel beating), or repainting. Bookings are made via our platform and fulfilled at our workshop.
Revenue streams will include commission or listing fees on vehicle sales, fees for workshop services, and markups on add-ons (warranties, customization work). For example, we might charge a 2–5% commission on each vehicle sale, a fixed rate for every repair job booked, and a margin on extended warranty plans. Financing referrals (through partner banks) could also earn a referral fee per approved loan. This model leverages synergies: as used-car sales grow, we capture after-sales service revenue. In fact, industry reports note that South Africa’s booming pre-owned car market (with year-over-year price increases of 15–19% for older vehicles​

) is “positive news for independent workshops”​

 – services our garage provides. Our unique value proposition is convenience and trust. Buyers can browse verified vehicles online (with detailed photos, histories, and warranty options) and instantly arrange service appointments all in one place. Sellers benefit from broad exposure and logistical support (we can even handle vehicle inspections or transportation). We will also build a community/trust system: verified seller badges, customer reviews, and transparent service ratings (following models like GetFix​

) to ensure quality. We will partner strategically with banks and insurers. For example, by collaborating with vehicle-financing lenders (such as Stanbic or First Capital in Zimbabwe, and major South African banks), we can pre-qualify buyers for loans and earn facilitation fees. Similarly, teaming up with insurance providers allows us to offer third-party extended warranty policies on used vehicles, sharing in the premium. Parts and accessories suppliers (for cars and motorcycles) will be contracted to guarantee quick turnaround for repairs and future parts sales. In sum, our business model balances online convenience with high-quality in-person service, tapping into multiple revenue streams from sales, servicing, and value-adds.
